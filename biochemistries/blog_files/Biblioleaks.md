## A provocative piece in the _Guardian_&nbsp;this week predicts an academic &lsquo;Biblioleaks&rsquo;

**As guerilla journalism organisation&nbsp;[_Wikileaks_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks)&nbsp;seeks to systematically publish classified materials, Dr Adam Dunn notes that academic file sharing is yet to reach critical mass in the way seen with films and music.**

[He speculates](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/14/australian-academics-seek-to-challenge-web-of-avarice-in-scientific-publishing) at the prospect of leaks _en masse_, though mention of the tragic case of Aaron Swartz is conspicuous in its absence here (the MIT student infamously [attempted as much from the JSTOR archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Aaron_Swartz)&nbsp;in 2010, and the [subsequent hounding he received from lawyers](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/07/aaron-swartz-suicide-internets-own-boy)&nbsp;is widely considered to have been responsible for his death).

The interview follows [a publication](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23445/full) in the _Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology_ ([PDF](http://www.irit.fr/publis/SIG/2015_JASIST_C.pdf)), the first to analyse the upstart &ldquo;text-sharing platform&rdquo; **LibGen**. Short for _Library Genesis_, the site is currently engaged in a game of cat and mouse with publishers, reminiscent of the [208-headed&nbsp;Hydra](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/world/europe/06wiki.html) of _Wikileaks_ and its mirrors.

Notably, the growth of the scientific articles within _LibGen_ (designated _scimag_) have clearly grown stepwise, through a series of discrete acquisitions, indicating &lsquo;Biblioleaks&rsquo; as predicted by [Dunn _et al._](http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/jmir.3331)&nbsp;in 2014 is well underway.

## _71% of the collection was&nbsp;collected at a rate of 100,000+ papers a day_

> <sub>Should we truly expect that biomedical publishing is somehow at less risk than other content-generating industries? What of the larger threat&mdash;a &ldquo;Biblioleaks&rdquo; event&mdash;a database breach and public leak of the substantial archives of biomedical literature? As the expectation that all research should be available to everyone becomes the norm for a younger generation of researchers and the broader community, the motivations for such a leak are likely to grow.</sub>

I&rsquo;ve been reading the works of [Gregg Egan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_City) and William Gibson this summer, and was amused that the recent article described the&nbsp;&lsquo;Biblioleaks&rsquo; scenario as&nbsp;&ldquo;opening like a sci-fi novel&rdquo; (it&rsquo;d make for a pretty unambitious novel is all I&rsquo;ll say like where is the quantum ontology?!) but it&rsquo;s a fair point.

In this shocking and lawless dystopia, &ldquo;<strike>l33t&nbsp;h4x0rz</strike>&nbsp;hackers gain access to the databases of six publishers that together control access to the majority of subscription-based biomedical journal articles&rdquo;.

> <sub>This group makes copies of every article from every journal and releases them into the public domain. Subsets of articles are mirrored in anonymous peer-to-peer networks, creating a decentralized and multiply-redundant repository that is accessible to any human or computer algorithm. The repository grows when its users begin to add new and missing articles, creating a self-sustaining system of frictionless, free, and universal access to published research. While there would be recourse against offenders and **while the wider academic community may be unlikely to embrace illicit activity**, a robust international article-sharing underground is created. Academics in wealthy countries generally enjoy the privilege of institutional subscriptions to many journals, but articles that require payment to read or download (paywalled) are largely beyond the reach of everyone else and there is a substantial motivation to access this new resource.</sub>

This future is but a rogue agent away - except for the all-important section I&rsquo;ve emphasised above.

A [recent blog post](https://awayofhappening.wordpress.com/2015/07/17/the-library-genesis-project-the-easiest-way-to-find-full-text-articles-online-illegally/) by [Ryan Regier](https://twitter.com/ryregier)&nbsp;compares this to a simply more efficient version of the traditional copy request. _ResearchGate_&nbsp;has buttons to do so via author email, but [anecdotes](http://poynder.blogspot.ca/2015/06/hefce-elsevier-copy-request-button-and.html#more)&nbsp;about&nbsp;&lsquo;university lawyers&rsquo; suggest hesitance, and uncertainty about the exact legal status of this under academic &lsquo;fair use&rsquo;.

Ryan [highlights](https://awayofhappening.wordpress.com/2015/07/17/the-library-genesis-project-the-easiest-way-to-find-full-text-articles-online-illegally/) an exchange on the _LibGen_ forum between a Lebanese university and those responsible for the service, which gives an idea of their motivations.

I stumbled across this story from a jibe that&nbsp;&ldquo;**academics are some of the dumbest smart people I know**&rdquo;, commented above an excerpt of the Guardian&rsquo;s piece:

> <sub>&ldquo;Various text-sharing platforms distribute tens of millions of documents online for free,&rdquo; the study found. &ldquo;However, these are still unknown to most of academia. Only a handful of articles acknowledge their existence in short passages, and no systematic study of the available collections has been undertaken until now.&rdquo;</sub>

It&rsquo;s easy enough to criticise academics for failing to&nbsp;tackle this problem, but in reality the uncertain legality will put off those hustling away in professional networks - those based on reputation, and upstanding conduct. Fear of disciplinary measures is a strong deterrent to &ldquo;innovation&rdquo;.

The 2014 scifi thriller continued by drawing attention to the&nbsp;&ldquo;pull&rdquo; practice of requesting articles with the Twitter hashtag [#icanhazpdf](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23icanhazpdf&amp;src=hash), and&nbsp;&ldquo;push&rdquo; (_i.e._ donating) practice of the later [#pdftribute](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pdftribute&amp;src=hash) campaign, instigated in defiant memory of Swartz. It notes that both&nbsp;&ldquo;stabilised at low levels&rdquo;, _i.e._&nbsp;they meant well but predictably requests on-demand were of limited use in the grand scheme of things.

> <sub>Overall, the capacity to better link and synthesize research could also lead to improvements in automated literature discovery, expanding opportunities for new forms of research. With passive roles in the Biblioleaks scenario, the interests of authors of peer-reviewed research would be served, with no directly associated risks.</sub>

## The fate of _LibGen_

The biggest flaw in this hopeful analysis of _LibGen_ is one it couldn&rsquo;t really foresee, but that I&rsquo;ve already mentioned above. This article was accepted late last year, and published in March. Yet, by the end of June, the site had been [taken down amidst mounting legal pressure](https://torrentfreak.com/libgen-goes-down-as-legal-pressure-mounts-150622/). _TorrentFreak_&nbsp;reported:

> <sub>Libgen, the largest online repository of free books and academic articles, has pretty much vanished from the Internet. Earlier this month the site&rsquo;s operators were sued by academic publishing company Elsevier, who asked a New York federal court for a preliminary injunction hoping to keep the site down for good.</sub>

It&rsquo;s not hard to see why Elsevier was the one to take action when you look at the breakdown of publishers whose journals are available in LibGen.</sub>

At the time of writing the main site remains offline, but like _WikiLeaks_ or _The Pirate Bay_, takedowns just lead to more mirrors of the site (_as in the main picture, up top_).

A few threads circulated ahead of this takedown, [wondering whether Tor](https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/2jlmp7/putting_library_genesis_on_tor_12_million_ebooks/) (a secure&nbsp;[network and browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)) often known as "the dark web&rdquo;) could be a safe haven for the service - but somehow I can&rsquo;t see that being feasible for academics (both the technology&rsquo;s reputation, and that it&rsquo;s simply [not](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea) [designed](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/why-tor-is-slow) as a download network).

A burgenoning wave of peer-to-peer technologies looks about to surface, one of the protocols of which has a nicely self-explanatory name,&nbsp;&ldquo;[WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/)&rdquo; from Stanford alumnus [feross](http://tmblr.co/mozqjhuSr2Y6dsETQTymNqQ)&nbsp;(WebTorrent = [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) over [WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC)).

At the moment the &lsquo;[hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)&rsquo; it uses (short pieces of text encoding a unique&nbsp;&lsquo;key&rsquo; for file sharing through the web app) aren&rsquo;t cross-compatible with the sorts of torrents that fuel the free trade in illicit music and film (and journal articles), but rather are generated in a web browser, and retrieved the same way on the other end (by my understanding there&rsquo;s [a hybrid](https://github.com/feross/webtorrent-hybrid) which would allow this).
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmmx/shots/master/2015/Aug/FilePizza.png)

Brilliantly dorky proof-of-concept experiments like [file.pizza](http://file.pizza/) (served fresh from UC Berkeley) let you play around with 'decentralised&rsquo; file hosting in this nascent form, but it seems easy to envision these as the building blocks to some sort of crafty research-sharing network if the right minds get to work on the problem.

_FilePizza_ is a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; example of how to build on top of these technologies. For example, the links it generates (containing the hash for a file) are named through pizza toppings rather than a random chunk of text (as seen at&nbsp;[instant.io](https://instant.io/)).

In terms of accessibility and professional respectability it&rsquo;s hugely more appropriate of a solution than stashing papers on the dark-web. Likewise, where #icanhazPDF and similar&nbsp;&ldquo;bibliogift&rdquo; schemes are doomed to be niche activities, or rare and kind of awkward requests, a decentralised scheme could be simple and so enabling as to make its use unavoidable in a community facing paywalls at every turn.

_(As a recent graduate, having lost access to the library resources, and waiting for days on return emails from a JSTOR rep about faulty access to material through the alumni scheme, I&rsquo;m feeling this frustration more than usual.)_

(Dis?)honourable closing mention here to [&lsquo;**Sci-Hub**&rsquo;](https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-tears-down-academias-illegal-copyright-paywalls-150627/), a service which provides proxy access directly into institutional computer networks, allowing users to download PDFs from outside (and even jump onto another proxy server if the one in use doesn&rsquo;t have access to a requested item). Each article retrieved this way is then deposited into _LibGen_ (unlike #icanhazPDF, which generally runs via old-fashioned email meaning no residual benefit to the community afterwards).

This paper on LibGen ends with that classic line: _more research is needed._
